## Starting and finishing a development task

1. First, your code must work. You must understand what problem you are solving and understand how to solve that problem. 
You must ensure that the code you write is a faithful representation of that solution. You must manage every detail of that solution while remaining consistent within the language, platform, current architecture, and all the warts of the current system.

2. Your code must solve the problem set for you by the customer. Often the customer’s requirements do not actually solve the customer’s problems. It is up to you to see this and negotiate with the customer to ensure that the customer’s true needs are met.

3. Your code must fit well into the existing system. It should not increase the rigidity, fragility, or opacity of that system. The dependencies must be wellmanaged. In short, your code needs to follow solid engineering principles.

4. Your code must be readable by other programmers. This is not simply a matter of writing nice comments. Rather, it requires that you craft the code in such a way that it reveals your intent. This is hard to do. Indeed, this may be the most difficult thing a programmer can master.

## Distractions and blocking

  When you cannot concentrate and focus sufficiently, the code you write will be wrong. It will have bugs. It will have the wrong structure. It will be opaque and convoluted. It will not solve the customers’ real problems. In short, it will have to be reworked or redone. Working while distracted creates waste.
  
  **If you are tired or distracted, do not code. You’ll only wind up redoing what you did. Instead, find a way to eliminate the distractions and settle your mind.**
  
 ### WRITER ’S BLOCK
 
  Oddly enough there is a very simple solution. It works almost every time. It’s easy to do, and it can provide you with the momentum to get lots of code written.

#### The solution: Find a pair partner.
  It’s uncanny how well this works. As soon as you sit down next to someone else, the issues that were blocking you melt away. There is a physiological change that takes place when you work with someone. I don’t know what it is, but I can definitely feel it. There’s some kind of chemical change in my brain or body that breaks me through the blockage and gets me going again.
  
### CREATIVE INPUT
  There are other things I do to prevent blockage. I learned a long time ago thatcreative output depends on creative input.
I read a lot, and I read all kinds of material. I read material on software, politics, biology, astronomy, physics, chemistry, mathematics, and much more. However,I find that the thing that best primes the pump of creative output is science
fiction. For you, it might be something else.
